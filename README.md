# File Preview Image Service

_An implementaion of the schul-cloud file preview image service._

The filepreview service creates preview images from downloadable files by using the [filepreview-es6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filepreview-es6) generator.

## Usage

The filepreview service provides an http(s) endpoint to process incoming requests:

```
POST /filepreview
{
    "downloadUrl": "http://example.com/static/powerpoint1.ppt",
    "signedS3Url": "https://example.com/powerpoint1.png?options...",
    "callbackUrl": "http://example.com/callback/powerpoint1.ppt",
    "options": {
        "width": 200
    }
}
```

The service downloads the file from `downloadUrl`, creates the preview image,
makes a PUT request to the `signedS3Url` and reports the success/error to the `callbackUrl`.

More information to [presigned url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) you can find on AWS.

The payload has to be valid json, whereby the url parts are mandatory and the options optional.
The options can be.
Valid values are:

-   `width`, `height`: integer (pixel)
    The default `width` is 640, the height is calculated by the convert tool.
-   `quality`: 0-100 (used for jpeg)
-   `outputFormat`: [png (default), jpg, gif]
-   `orientation`: landscape
    If this option is used, a preview image will be created in landscape orientation, based on the width. The height is calculated according to DIN A4 standard.

The success report to the `callbackUrl` is a request:

```
PATCH <callbackUrl>
 {'thumbnail': 'https://example.com/powerpoint1.png'}
```

The error report to the `callbackUrl` is a request:

```
PATCH <callbackUrl>
 {'error': 'An error occured: <errormessage>'}
```

## File types

The supported file-types are: [document-formats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filepreview-es6#document-formats) (only the usual office types are tested)

The file-type detection is based on the download file's `content-type` header field. The file server **must** provide this header! The according file-type / extension mapping is taken from the [filepreview-es6 generators database](https://github.com/sahilsharmafrank/filepreview/blob/master/db.json).

## Testing

1. Start docker
2. `npm run test`

## Requirements

Since the filepreview service uses [kue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue) job queue, a redis server is necessary. For this, the `REDIS_HOST` has to be provided as environment variables at startup.

## Docker

A docker image is created based on the `node:10.5.0-stretch` Debian-Stretch NodeJS image.
In development mode, `docker-compose` is used to get both executed and connected. (See more details in `docker-compose.yml`)
In production mode, however, an existing `docker-compose.yml` file can already be used. This file must be adjusted accordingly. The necessary environment variables are `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` and the `REDIS_HOST` (and `REDIS_AUTH` if needed).

## Non-Docker installation

If docker should not be used, the service can be installed in a Debian Stretch virtual machine (or container).
Adapt installation procedure from `Dockerfile`. Set the environment variables according to the `docker-compose.yml`.
